r2VIM 1.3
=========
* bug fixes:
  - calculate error for multiple threading of parallelRandomForest methods (not returned in randomForest object)
* changes:
  - automatic check of operating system

r2VIM 1.2
=========
* changes by ERH:
  - added code to some of the functions so that the package will run on    
    Windows versions of R by adding a logical windows paramter to specific           
    functions (note this does require additional installation of rjungle for 
    windows, PLINK for windows, and software that allows Unix commands to 
    run in Windows)
  - updated and added to documentation to include: installation manual, 
    tutorial, r2VIM reference manual, and parallelRandomForest reference 
    manual (in separate zip file).
